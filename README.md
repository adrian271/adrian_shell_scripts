My favorite Shell Scripts!

Just clone the repository and copy and paste over to your zshrc. I prefer throwing the supporting files like how zshrc.sh shows, that file is more of an example of what you want to see in your actual .zshrc file

It's better to load things in `.zshrc` instead of `.zshenv` because of the circumstances of when `.zshrc` actually gets loaded from what I hear.
